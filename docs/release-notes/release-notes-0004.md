## Updates

The following major and minor features were added in this release.

### Added support for wildcard hostnames in haproxy-route relation
Added support for wildcard hostnames (e.g., *.example.com) in the haproxy-route relation. Hostnames can now include a wildcard prefix, allowing a single backend to handle requests for multiple subdomains. The wildcard character (*) cannot be used at the TLD level.
HAProxy configuration now uses '-m end' matching for wildcard hostnames instead of exact matching ('-i'), ensuring proper routing of requests to wildcard domains.
Added the 'validators' library dependency to validate domain names with wildcard support.

### Fix remove ca certificate relation where there are still ca certificates.
Instead of removing the cas.pem file when removing a CA relation, call the update_trusted_cas() method. Update the update_trusted_cas() method to check if all CAs have been removed.

### Added support for wildcard SNIs in haproxy-route-tcp relation
Added support for wildcard Server Name Indication (SNI) patterns (e.g., *.example.com)  in the haproxy-route-tcp relation. This is a major version bump of the haproxy-route-tcp  library from v0 to v1.
Backends can now use wildcard SNI prefixes to handle connections for multiple subdomains  with a single relation, instead of requiring separate haproxy-route-tcp relations for  each subdomain. The wildcard character (*) cannot be used at the TLD level.
HAProxy configuration now uses '-m end' matching for wildcard SNIs instead of exact  matching ('-i'), ensuring proper routing of TLS connections based on SNI.
Requirer charms using this library must include the 'validators' Python package in their  dependencies (charm-python-packages in charmcraft.yaml) for domain validation.
This change follows the same pattern as PR #364 which added wildcard support for the  haproxy-route relation.

### Fixed issues with the DDoS protection configurator charm found in staging.
Removed "assumes juju >= 3.6" for the HAProxy DDoS protection configurator charm. The HAProxy DDoS protection configurator charm works without requiring Juju version 3.6 or  higher. This change enhances compatibility with earlier Juju versions.
Added the `sc` prefix to the `conn_rate` and `conn_cur` options in the HAProxy template.
Fixed the previous PR's changelog and artifact to accurately reflect requirer instead of provider.
